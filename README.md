## Introduction

Air quality is a major concern in urban environments due to factors like high traffic, industrial activities, and dense populations. This project aims to analyze air pollution levels, focusing on pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, and O₃, and examine how weather conditions impact these levels.

## Features

- **Dataset Selection:** Users can select from multiple air quality and weather datasets.
- **Interactive Filters:** Filter data by date range and city.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Pollution levels over time.
  - Impact of weather factors on air quality.
  - Correlation heatmaps.
- **Data Overview:** View raw data for selected datasets.
- **Conclusion and Insights:** Summarized findings and recommendations.

## Datasets

The datasets are sourced from open-access repositories and are included in the `data/` directory of this project. Users can select which datasets to analyze through the dashboard interface.

### Air Quality Datasets

- **Dataset 1:** Air Quality Open Data Platform (World AQI)
- **Dataset 2:** European Environment Agency - Air Quality Database
- **Dataset 3:** US EPA Air Quality System Data (AQS)

### Weather Datasets

- **Dataset 1:** NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)
- **Dataset 2:** European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D)
